    <h2>Hi! Bonjour! Salut!</h2>
    <p>I'm Jennifer Chapman (Andreoli-Fang), builder of AI systems. I have a PhD in networks and machine learning. I grew up listening to stories of Marie Curie and learning about protons and electrons, and building circuits on breadboards in a small town in Virginia.</p>
    <p>My focus is on building AI-powered solutions in logistics and fintech. I am advising several startups in these spaces.</p>
    <p>My day job is at <a href="https://www.colt.com/" target="_blank">Colt Technology Services</a> where I am leading the development of AI solutions for Colt's global connectivity network, as well as building Colt's AI Center of Excellence. Get in touch if you know any good AI and MLOps engineers in Boulder, Colorado.</p>
    <p>Prior to Colt, I worked at AWS where I led the development of AI solutions for the cable industry. I also worked at <a href="https://www.cablelabs.com/" target="_blank">CableLabs</a>, the cable industry's R&D lab, where I led the development of DOCSIS technology, as well as mobile LTE, 5G, and Wi-Fi. If you use cable internet, you're using DOCSIS, the technology I helped develop.</p>
    <p>I enjoy buliding projects, learning about fun technical challenges, and collaborating with great teams. Whether you are looking for a speaker, an advisor, a co-founder, or a collaborator, reach out and let's find a way to work together!</p>
    <p>Off work, I enjoying painting landscapes with oil in the studio and in plein air. I also enjoy running trails and paddleboard with my White Swiss Shepherd puppy Snowy. She is a little celebrity on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/snowyinboulder" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>
