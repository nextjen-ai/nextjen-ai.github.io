    <h2>Hi! Bonjour! Grüezi!</h2>
    <p>I'm Jennifer Chapman (Andreoli-Fang), builder of AI systems. I have a PhD in networks and machine learning. I grew up listening to stories of Marie Curie and building circuits on breadboards in a small town in Virginia.</p>
    <p>My focus is on building AI-powered solutions in logistics and fintech. I am advising several startups in these spaces.</p>
    <p>My day job is at <a href="https://www.colt.com/" target="_blank">Colt Technology Services</a> where I am leading the development of AI solutions leveraging Colt's global connectivity network, as well as building Colt's AI Center of Excellence. Get in touch if you know any exceptional AI and MLOps engineers near Boulder, Colorado.</p>
    <p>Prior to Colt, I worked at AWS where I led the development of AI and cloud solutions for the cable industry. I also worked at <a href="https://www.cablelabs.com/" target="_blank">CableLabs</a>, the R&D lab for the global cable industry, where I led the development of DOCSIS technology, as well as mobile LTE, 5G, and Wi-Fi. If you use cable internet, you're using DOCSIS, the technology I drove from idea to deployment.</p>
    <p>I enjoy buliding projects, learning about fun technical challenges, and collaborating with great teams. I am a technical advisor for two AI startups. Whether you are looking for a speaker, an advisor, a co-founder, or a collaborator, reach out and let's find a way to work together!</p>
    <p>Off work, I enjoying painting landscapes with oil in the studio and in plein air. I also enjoy running trails and paddleboard with my White Swiss Shepherd puppy Snowy. She is a little celebrity on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/snowyinboulder" target="_blank">Instagram</a>. My goal is to hike the Colorado Trail with Snowy in 2027.</p>
