    <h2>Hi! Bonjour! Salut!</h2>
    <p>I'm Jennifer Chapman (Andreoli-Fang), CTO and builder of AI systems. I have a PhD in machine learning and networks. I grew up listening to stories of Marie Curie and learning about protons and electrons, and building circuits on breadboards in a small town in Virginia.</p>
    <p>My focus is on building AI-powered tools to help people and organizations. I'm currently exploring use cases of AI in health tech, data center, logistics, and finance.</p>
    <p>My other job is at AWS where I led the development of AI and cloud solutions for the cable industry. Before that, I worked at CableLabs, the cable industry's R&D lab, where I led the development of DOCSIS technology, as well as mobile LTE, 5G, and Wi-Fi. If you use cable internet, you're using DOCSIS, the technology I developed!</p>
    <p>I enjoy buliding projects, learning about fun technical challenges, and collaborating with great teams. Whether you are looking for a speaker, a strategist, a co-founder, or a collaborator, reach out and let's find a way to work together!</p>
    <p>Off work, I enjoying painting landscapes with oil in the studio and in plein air. I also enjoy running trails and paddleboard with my White Swiss Shepherd puppy Snowy. She is a little celebrity on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/snowyinboulder" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>
