    <h2>Hi! Bonjour! Salut!</h2>
    <p>I'm Jennifer Chapman (Andreoli-Fang), CTO and builder of AI systems. I have a PhD in networks and machine learning. I grew up listening to stories of Marie Curie and learning about protons and electrons, and building circuits on breadboards in a small town in Virginia.</p>
    <p>My focus is on building AI-powered solutions to help people and organizations. I'm currently exploring use cases of AI in logistics and finance.</p>
    <p>My day job is at <a href="https://www.colt.com/" target="_blank">Colt Technology Services</a> where I am leading the development of AI solutions for Colt's global connectivitynetwork. Prior to Colt, I worked at AWS where I led the development of AI solutions for the cable industry. I also worked at <a href="https://www.cablelabs.com/" target="_blank">CableLabs</a>, the cable industry's R&D lab, where I led the development of DOCSIS technology, as well as mobile LTE, 5G, and Wi-Fi. If you use cable internet, you're using DOCSIS, the technology I developed!</p>
    <p>I enjoy buliding projects, learning about fun technical challenges, and collaborating with great teams. Whether you are looking for a speaker, an advisor, a co-founder, or a collaborator, reach out and let's find a way to work together!</p>
    <p>Off work, I enjoying painting landscapes with oil in the studio and in plein air. I also enjoy running trails and paddleboard with my White Swiss Shepherd puppy Snowy. She is a little celebrity on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/snowyinboulder" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>
